interpreted-language
====================

## Mentor assignment:
Implement a simple programming language using Python. For the sake of argument, let's call the language Anaconda. When you run the anaconda interpreter, you will give it a file of anaconda source code (suffix .an), just as when you run the python interpreter you give it a file of python source code. So, executing an anaconda program on the command line would look something like this:

python anaconda.py program.an

Now, to get started, let's go with something very basic. Anaconda will support setting variables to values, performing binary arithmetic operations and printing the value of a variable or literal. For example, all the following statements would be legal:

x = 5  

y = x * x  

print y  


Running this program should emit the value: 25.
